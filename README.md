## Calculate commuting fuel costs.
----

**Information architecture:**

Here's a straightforward method to calculate the cost of commuting. By providing the fuel price, distance to work, and your car's average fuel consumption, you'll receive a graph along with some helpful calculations. The average fuel cost per day allows annual expenses estimation based on current data. The app also monitors extreme values and displays the percentage change between them.

**Design:**

The form collects only essential information for calculations. As job changes are less frequent than refuelings, there is no need to manually update all inputs regularly. The graph illustrates the price trend, while hovering over the dots reveals additional data.
